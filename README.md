Senior Backend Engineer with 5 years of professional experience specializing in high-quality, scalable, and efficient solutions using JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Firebase, Serverless, and leveraging cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP.

- Distributed Teams (cross-functional team): I have experience working in dynamic early-stage startup environments, I directly collaborated with both the CEO and manager in a New York-based company. Currently, I am part of a diverse team consisting of talented professionals from the USA and Canada.

- Architecture and Integrations: I have successfully designed and implemented distributed backends, leveraging microservice architecture and Event-Driven Architecture. Additionally, I have integrated systems with external third-party APIs to enhance application functionality and improve user experiences.

- Leadership: I have demonstrated leadership skills by leading teams and mentoring fellow engineers. I strongly believe in a supportive team culture that encourages growth, collaboration, and knowledge sharing.

I'm interested in opportunities as a contractor for product-based companies. 

Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate on exciting projects!
