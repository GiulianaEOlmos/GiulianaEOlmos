Senior Backend Engineer with 7+ years of professional experience specializing in high-quality, scalable, and efficient solutions using JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Firebase, Serverless, and leveraging cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP.

- Distributed Teams (cross-functional team):  I have experience working in dynamic early-stage startup environments, and I worked closely with product and C-levels in New York and San Francisco-based companies. I was part of a diverse team consisting of talented professionals from the USA and Canada.

- Architecture and Integrations: I have successfully designed and implemented distributed backends, using microservice architecture and Event-Driven Architecture. Additionally, I have integrated systems with external third-party APIs to enhance application functionality and improve user experiences.

- Leadership: I have demonstrated leadership by guiding and mentoring fellow engineers, taking initiative in collaborative projects, and contributing to team success through knowledge sharing and support. I strongly believe in a supportive team culture that encourages growth, collaboration, and knowledge sharing.

✨ I'm interested in opportunities as a contractor for product-based companies. ✨

Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate on exciting projects! 🚀
